Before running tasks 8 and 9, a new database will need to be created. To do this, simply run the create_db.py file. Please note that this will generate
two database files: initial_database.db and task8_9_database.db. 

** Please also note that if there is data in initial_database.db, this will be erased **

### Task 8 In: ###

- Run the application from the command line
- You will be prompted to provide input for the csv file name (including the .csv extension)
- Once input has been provided, the application will push the data into 'task8_9_database.db'

### Task 8 Out: ###

- Similar to before, run the application from the command line
- You will be prompted to provide input for the database you would like to query - this will be choice between initial_database.db and task8_9_database.db
- You will then be prompted to provide input for the starting and end date and time - please note that if you do not provide a date and time in the 
  correct format, you will continue to be asked until you do
- Once valid input hsa been provided, the application will produce a csv file named task8_out.csv in the current directory

### Task 9 In: ###

- Similar to task 8 in, you will be prompted for a csv file name and then the application will push the data into the task8_9_database.db file

### Task 9 Out: ###

- Similar to task 9 in, you will be prompted to provide the database file name which you would like to run the query on
- Next, you will prompted to provide a date in a specific format until you do so
- Please note that the application would not detect if you were to put the numbers in the wrong order e.g. DDMMYYYY
- The query will then be sent to the database you indicated and a csv file named task9_out.csv will be produced in the current directory
